# MyReads Library

A MyReads Books Library, which categorizes a group of selected books via 3 distinct bookshelves:
1. Currently Enjoy Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Already Read

----

Each book has a set of controls that allow the user to move the book to a different bookshelf. If you would like to view more details about the book, click the `View Details` link underneath each of the books in the bookshelf.

NOTE: This link is not available while searching for a particular book on the `/search` page.

---

There is an available `/search` page, where you can search for a particular book and add it to your Library, on one of the available bookshelves off course. Access this page by clicking on the search icon towards the bottom right of the browser's window.
