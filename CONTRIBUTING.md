## Best Practices

Make sure to follow these conventions:

* Commit message must begin with a `type` prefix. i.e. feat, fix, etc.
* Commit message must have a solid subject line that describes the work that was done.

Example of a commit message:

````javascript
feat: adding in a loading spinner component, displayed during API calls, and component loading.
````

##### Commit Message Types:

* `feat`: a new feature
* `fix`: a bug fix
* `docs`: changes to documentation
* `style`: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
* `refactor`: refactoring production code
* `test`: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
* `chore`: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change
